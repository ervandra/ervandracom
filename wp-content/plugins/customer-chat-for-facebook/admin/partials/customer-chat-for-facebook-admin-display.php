								Try picking a plugin that is updated frequently or recently. That usually means the developer does a lot of work on it to make sure things like that don\'t happen. <br/>
								As another option you can go ahead delete this plugin(it won\'t hurt my feelings) and add the code manually using <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/customer-chat-plugin/#steps" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook\'s Documentation</strong></a> and <a href="/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=plugin-information&plugin=custom-css-js&TB_iframe=true&width=772&height=669" target="_blank"><strong>this plugin</strong></a>.', $this->Customer_Chat ); ?>

								https://connect.facebook.net/hr/sdk/xfbml.customerchat.js <br />
