Developing a single page React app but still want to use the WordPress theme based fronted.

Not a problem, maybe you just use these modules:

* Adds Gutenberg block data to REST responses

* Removes non required REST endpoints


Developing a truly headless WordPress single page app or mobile app and just want WordPress for the backend?

Maybe use these modules:

* JSON Web Token Authentication
* Adds Gutenberg block data to REST responses
* Protects REST requests with nonce
* Cleans up REST response objects
* Removes non required REST endpoints
* Disable the WordPress frontend

You get the idea.

The plugin documentation is held inside the plugin ‘options’ page in the WordPress admin, although there are some docs for the custom rest endpoints:
